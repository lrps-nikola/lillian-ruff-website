Fleas are more than just an annoyance—they can cause serious health issues and are notoriously difficult to eliminate once established. Prevention is truly the best medicine.

## Understanding Fleas

### Flea Life Cycle
- **Eggs**: Laid on the dog, fall off into environment
- **Larvae**: Develop in carpets, bedding, soil
- **Pupae**: Can remain dormant for months
- **Adults**: Jump onto host to feed and reproduce

A single flea can lay up to 50 eggs per day!

## Signs of Flea Infestation

- Excessive scratching, licking, or biting
- Red, irritated skin
- Hair loss (especially near tail base)
- Small black specks in fur (flea dirt)
- Visible fleas (fast-moving, reddish-brown)
- Pale gums (severe cases—anemia)
- Tapeworm segments in stool

## Health Risks from Fleas

- **Flea Allergy Dermatitis**: Allergic reaction to flea saliva
- **Anemia**: Severe infestations can cause dangerous blood loss
- **Tapeworms**: Transmitted when dogs swallow fleas
- **Bacterial infections**: From scratching

## Prevention Methods

### Veterinary Products
Most effective options include:
- **Monthly topicals**: Applied between shoulder blades
- **Oral medications**: Monthly or every 3 months
- **Flea collars**: Long-lasting protection (some up to 8 months)

### Natural Alternatives
Less effective but can help:
- Diatomaceous earth (food grade)
- Essential oil sprays (use cautiously)
- Regular washing of bedding
- Frequent vacuuming

### Environmental Control
- Vacuum frequently (daily during infestation)
- Wash pet bedding weekly in hot water
- Treat yard if needed
- Consider professional pest control

## Year-Round Protection

Many people stop flea prevention in winter—don't! Fleas can survive indoors year-round. Consistent, year-round prevention is essential.

## How Grooming Helps

Regular professional grooming aids flea prevention by:
- Thorough bathing removes fleas and eggs
- Close inspection catches early infestations
- Keeping coat clean and healthy
- Using flea-deterrent shampoos

## What to Do If You Find Fleas

1. **Treat your pet** with vet-recommended products
2. **Treat ALL pets** in the household
3. **Wash all bedding** in hot water
4. **Vacuum everything** and dispose of bag immediately
5. **Treat your home** with appropriate products
6. **Treat your yard** if needed
7. **Continue treatment** for at least 3 months

## Flea Prevention Mistakes

- Skipping winter months
- Treating only some pets in household
- Not treating the environment
- Using products not approved for your pet's species/size
- Inconsistent application
