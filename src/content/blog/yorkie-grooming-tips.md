Yorkshire Terriers are tiny dogs with big grooming needs. Their silky, human-like hair grows continuously and requires dedicated care to stay beautiful and healthy.

## The Yorkie Coat

Yorkie hair is unique:
- Similar texture to human hair

- Hypoallergenic (produces less dander)
- Color changes from black/tan to blue/gold with age

## Daily Grooming Must-Dos

### Brushing
- Use a pin brush or boar bristle brush
- Brush from roots to tips
- Work in small sections
- Use detangling spray for easier brushing

### Face Care
- Wipe eyes daily to prevent tear stains
- Clean beard after meals
- Keep topknot clean and neat

### Topknot Styling
