Keeping your dog well-groomed isn't just about looking good—it's essential for their health and happiness. But how often should you actually take your pup to the groomer? The answer depends on several factors.

## Factors That Determine Grooming Frequency

### Coat Type

**Short-haired breeds** (like Beagles, Boxers, and Dalmatians) typically need professional grooming every 8-12 weeks. Their coats are low-maintenance but still benefit from regular baths and nail trims.

**Medium-haired breeds** (like Golden Retrievers and Border Collies) should visit the groomer every 6-8 weeks. These coats can mat if neglected and need regular brushing between appointments.

**Long-haired breeds** (like Shih Tzus, Maltese, and Yorkshire Terriers) require the most frequent care—every 4-6 weeks. Their coats grow continuously and can become tangled and uncomfortable without regular maintenance.

**Double-coated breeds** (like Huskies, German Shepherds, and Samoyeds) need grooming every 8-12 weeks, with extra attention during shedding seasons.

### Lifestyle Considerations

- **Active outdoor dogs** may need more frequent baths and grooming
- **Dogs with allergies** benefit from regular bathing with medicated shampoos
- **Senior dogs** may need gentler, more frequent grooming sessions

## Signs Your Dog Needs Grooming

Don't wait for your scheduled appointment if you notice:

- Visible mats or tangles in the coat
- Overgrown nails clicking on the floor
- Dirty or smelly ears
- Eye discharge or tear staining
- Unpleasant body odor
