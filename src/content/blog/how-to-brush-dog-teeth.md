Dental health is often overlooked, but it's crucial for your dog's overall wellbeing. Poor oral hygiene can lead to serious health problems.

## Why Dental Care Matters

Untreated dental disease can cause:
- Painful infections
- Tooth loss
- Difficulty eating
- Bad breath
- Bacteria entering the bloodstream
- Heart, liver, and kidney problems

## Signs of Dental Problems

Watch for:
- Persistent bad breath
- Yellow or brown tartar buildup
- Red, swollen, or bleeding gums
- Difficulty eating or dropping food
- Pawing at the mouth
- Loose or missing teeth
- Drooling more than usual

## What You'll Need

- Dog-specific toothbrush (or finger brush)
- Dog toothpaste (never human toothpaste!)
- Patience and treats

## Step-by-Step Teeth Brushing

### Week 1: Get Them Used to It
- Let them taste the toothpaste
- Lift their lips gently
- Touch their teeth and gums with your finger

### Week 2: Introduce the Brush
- Let them lick toothpaste off the brush
- Gently touch the brush to their front teeth
- Keep sessions short (30 seconds)

### Week 3: Start Brushing
- Brush the front teeth in small circles
- Gradually work toward back teeth
- Focus on the outer surfaces (cheek side)
- Aim for 2 minutes total

## Brushing Tips

- **Angle the brush 45 degrees** toward the gum line
- **Focus on the outside** - the tongue naturally cleans the inside
- **Use dog toothpaste flavors** they love (chicken, beef, peanut butter)
- **Make it positive** with praise and treats after

## How Often to Brush

- **Ideal**: Daily
- **Minimum**: 3 times per week
- **Professional cleaning**: Annually (ask your vet)

## Alternatives to Brushing

If your dog won't tolerate brushing:
- Dental chews and treats
- Water additives
- Dental wipes
- Dental sprays
- Raw bones (supervised)

## Professional Dental Care

Some tartar requires professional removal under anesthesia. Regular grooming and home care help minimize the need for dental procedures.
