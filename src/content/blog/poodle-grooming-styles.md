Poodles are known for their versatile, non-shedding coats that can be styled in countless ways. Whether you prefer practical or show-stopping, there's a Poodle cut for everyone.

## Understanding Poodle Coats

Poodle hair grows continuously and doesn't shed like other breeds. This means:
- Regular grooming is essential (every 4-6 weeks)
- Without grooming, hair will mat severely
- You have endless styling options!
