Labrador Retrievers are America's most popular breed, beloved for their friendly personalities and versatile abilities. Their distinctive double coat requires regular maintenance to stay healthy and manage shedding.

## Understanding the Lab Coat

Labs have a unique coat designed for water work:
- **Undercoat**: Dense, soft, insulating
- **Outer coat**: Short, straight, water-resistant
- **Natural oils**: Provide water repellency

This coat sheds year-round with heavy shedding twice yearly.

## Why You Should Never Shave a Lab

Shaving a Lab's coat:
- Removes natural insulation and cooling
- Increases risk of sunburn
- May cause coat to grow back improperly
- Doesn't actually reduce shedding

Instead, focus on proper maintenance!

## Weekly Grooming Routine

### Brushing (2-3 times weekly)
1. Use an undercoat rake to remove loose undercoat
2. Follow with a slicker brush
3. Finish with a bristle brush for shine
4. Pay attention to hindquarters and neck

### Quick Checks
- Ears (Labs are prone to infections)
- Paws (check between toes)
- Skin (look for hot spots)
- Eyes (clear and bright)

## Shedding Season Care

During heavy shedding (spring and fall):
- Brush daily for 10-15 minutes
- Use a deshedding tool
- Consider a professional deshedding treatment
- Bathe with deshedding shampoo

Professional deshedding can remove up to 80% of loose undercoat!

## Bathing Your Lab

### Frequency
Every 4-6 weeks, or when dirty

### Tips
- Use lukewarm water
- Apply shampoo designed for double coats
- Massage down to the undercoat
- Rinse thoroughly (residue causes itching)
- Use a high-velocity dryer if available

### Drying
Labs can take a long time to dry completely. Ensure the undercoat is fully dry to prevent hot spots.

## Common Lab Grooming Issues

### Hot Spots
- Common in Labs due to dense coat
- Keep coat clean and dry
- Address immediately when spotted
- May need veterinary treatment

### Ear Infections
- Floppy ears trap moisture
- Clean weekly
- Dry ears thoroughly after swimming
- Watch for redness, odor, or discharge

### Allergies
Labs are prone to skin allergies causing:
- Excessive scratching
- Hot spots
- Ear infections
- May require special shampoos

### Obesity
Overweight Labs shed more and have skin issues. Maintain a healthy weight!

## Exercise and Water Activities

After swimming or outdoor activities:
- Rinse off chlorine, salt, or pond water
- Dry ears thoroughly
- Check for ticks and debris
- Brush to remove tangles

## Professional Grooming Benefits

While Labs don't need haircuts, professional grooming offers:
- Thorough deshedding
- Ear cleaning and nail trimming
- Hot spot checks
- Expert coat assessment
- Anal gland expression

Keep your Lab's coat healthy and your house fur-free! [Book a deshedding session](/grooming).
