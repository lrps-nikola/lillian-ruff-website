Drying your dog properly after a bath is just as important as the bath itself. Improper drying can lead to skin issues, matting, and discomfort.

## Why Proper Drying Matters

### Skin Health
- Trapped moisture causes bacterial and yeast growth
- Can lead to hot spots
- Causes skin irritation
- Creates unpleasant odor

### Coat Health
- Wet fur mats more easily
- Air drying can cause tangles
- Curly coats especially vulnerable
- Proper drying maintains coat texture

## Drying Methods

### Towel Drying

**Best for**: Starting the drying process, short-coated breeds

**Technique**:
- Use absorbent microfiber towels
- Press and squeeze—don't rub
- Rubbing causes tangles and breaks hair
- Change towels when saturated
- Focus on getting excess water out

### Air Drying

**Best for**: Short-coated breeds in warm weather only

**Cautions**:
- Never for thick or long coats
- Can cause matting in curly coats
- Keep dog warm until dry
- Not recommended in cold weather

### Blow Dryer

**Best for**: Most dogs, essential for thick and long coats

**Types**:
- **Human hair dryers**: Use on cool or low heat only
- **High-velocity dryers**: Professional tool, no heat needed
- **Pet-specific dryers**: Designed for dog coats
