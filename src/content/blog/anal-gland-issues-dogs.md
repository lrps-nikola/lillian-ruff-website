Anal glands are small sacs located on either side of your dog's anus. While not a pleasant topic, understanding these glands is important for your dog's health and comfort.

## What Are Anal Glands?

Anal glands produce a smelly, oily substance used for:
- Scent marking
- Communication with other dogs
- Lubrication during defecation

In healthy dogs, the glands naturally express during bowel movements.

## Signs of Anal Gland Problems

Watch for these symptoms:
- **Scooting**: Dragging bottom across the floor
- Excessive licking of the rear area
- Difficulty sitting or reluctance to sit
- Chasing or biting at the tail
- Swelling near the anus
- Foul, fishy odor
- Blood or pus near the anus
- Straining during bowel movements

## Common Anal Gland Issues

### Impaction
Glands become full and unable to empty naturally.
- Most common problem

### Infection
Bacteria enters the glands, causing:
- Swelling and pain
- Discharge

Untreated infection leads to:
