Cockapoos—the adorable Cocker Spaniel and Poodle mix—are beloved for their friendly personalities and low-shedding coats. But that beautiful curly fur requires dedicated grooming.

## Understanding Cockapoo Coats

Cockapoo coats vary based on genetics:
- **Tight curls**: More Poodle-like, less shedding
- **Loose waves**: Mix of both parents
- **Straight/flat**: More Cocker Spaniel-like, more shedding

All types need regular grooming!

## Daily Care

### Brushing (Essential!)
- Brush daily or every other day
- Use a slicker brush first
- Follow with a metal comb
- Work through the entire coat to the skin

### Problem Areas
Focus on:
- Behind ears
- Under collar
- Armpits
- Behind legs
- Belly

## Popular Cockapoo Haircuts

## Professional Grooming Schedule

Cockapoos need grooming every 6-8 weeks:

### Process
1. Brush out all mats BEFORE bathing

## At-Home Maintenance

Between professional grooming:
- Brush daily

- Trim around eyes if needed

## Coat Changes

Cockapoo puppies often have different coats than adults:
- Puppy coat is usually softer
- Adult coat comes in around 8-12 months

- Grooming needs may increase
