Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are beloved for their gentle nature and beautiful, flowing coats. Their silky fur requires regular attention to stay healthy and tangle-free.

## Understanding the Cavalier Coat

Cavaliers have a medium-length, silky coat with:
- Feathering on ears, chest, legs, and tail
- Moderate shedding
- Prone to tangles, especially in feathering
- No undercoat (single-coated)

## Weekly Grooming Routine

### Brushing (3-4 times per week)
- Use a pin brush or slicker brush
- Focus on feathered areas
- Comb through with metal comb
- Check behind ears especially

### Ear Care
Cavaliers' long, floppy ears need attention:
- Check inside weekly
- Clean with ear solution
- Watch for infection signs
- Keep ear feathering tangle-free

## Professional Grooming Schedule

Every 6-8 weeks for:
- Full bath and blow-dry
- Trimming and tidying
- Nail trimming
- Ear cleaning
- Sanitary trim

## Trimming Options

### Natural Look (Show Style)
- Minimal trimming
- Neaten feet and sanitary areas
- Maintain natural feathering
- Trim only straggly hairs

### Tidied Pet Look
- Shaped feathering
- Trimmed ears (less dragging)
- Neater feet
- Easier maintenance

### Puppy Cut

## Common Cavalier Grooming Issues

### Ear Infections
- Very common in the breed
- Long ears trap moisture
- Clean weekly
- Dry after baths and swimming

### Matting
- Behind ears is worst spot

## Bathing Tips

- Brush before bathing
- Use gentle, moisturizing shampoo
- Condition the feathering
- Rinse thoroughly
- Dry completely, especially ears

## Shedding Management

Cavaliers shed moderately:
- More during seasonal changes
- Regular brushing reduces loose hair
- Deshedding treatments help
- Good nutrition supports coat health

## Dental Care

Cavaliers can be prone to dental issues:
- Brush teeth regularly
- Provide dental chews
- Regular vet dental checks

## Special Considerations

### Heart Conditions
Many Cavaliers have heart conditions. Inform your groomer so they can:
- Monitor for stress
- Keep sessions calm
- Avoid over-exertion
- Watch for breathing changes
