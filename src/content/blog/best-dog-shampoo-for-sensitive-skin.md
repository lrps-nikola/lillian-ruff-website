If your dog scratches, licks, or seems uncomfortable after bath time, they may have sensitive skin. Choosing the right shampoo can make all the difference.

## Signs Your Dog Has Sensitive Skin

- Excessive scratching or licking after baths
- Red, irritated, or flaky skin
- Hot spots or recurring skin infections
- Dull, dry coat
- Unpleasant odor that returns quickly

## Ingredients to Avoid

Stay away from shampoos containing:
- **Artificial fragrances** - major irritants
- **Parabens** - preservatives that can cause reactions
- **Sulfates** - harsh cleansing agents
- **Alcohol** - dries out the skin
- **Artificial dyes** - unnecessary irritants

## Ingredients to Look For

Choose shampoos with:
- **Oatmeal** - soothes itchy, irritated skin
- **Aloe vera** - natural moisturizer and healer
- **Coconut oil** - hydrates and conditions
- **Chamomile** - calms inflammation
- **Vitamin E** - nourishes and protects skin
- **Honey** - natural antibacterial properties

## Types of Sensitive Skin Shampoos

### Hypoallergenic Shampoos
Formulated without common allergens, ideal for dogs with unknown sensitivities.

### Medicated Shampoos
Contain active ingredients to treat specific conditions like yeast or bacterial infections. Always consult your vet before use.

### Oatmeal-Based Shampoos
Perfect for general itchiness and dry skin. Gentle enough for frequent use.

### Soap-Free Shampoos
Use alternative cleansing agents that won't strip natural oils.

## Bathing Tips for Sensitive Dogs

1. **Use lukewarm water** - hot water can irritate skin
2. **Dilute the shampoo** - easier to rinse out completely
3. **Rinse thoroughly** - leftover product causes irritation
4. **Pat dry gently** - avoid rubbing
5. **Don't over-bathe** - every 4-6 weeks is usually sufficient
