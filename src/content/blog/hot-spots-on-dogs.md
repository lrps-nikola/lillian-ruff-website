Hot spots, also called acute moist dermatitis, are painful, red, oozing skin lesions that can appear suddenly and spread rapidly. They're one of the most common skin conditions in dogs.

## What Are Hot Spots?

Hot spots are areas of inflamed, infected skin caused by:
- Self-trauma from scratching, licking, or chewing
- Bacterial infection on damaged skin
- Moisture trapped against the skin

## Common Causes

### Allergies
- Food allergies
- Environmental allergies (pollen, dust, mold)
- Flea allergies (most common cause)

### Moisture
- Poor drying after swimming or bathing
- Humid weather
- Dense undercoat trapping moisture

### Skin Irritation
- Matted fur
- Insect bites
- Scratches or wounds
- Ear infections (causing head scratching)

### Behavioral
- Boredom
- Anxiety
- Stress

## Signs of Hot Spots

- Red, moist, irritated skin
- Hair loss in the area
- Constant licking, scratching, or chewing
- Oozing or pus
- Foul odor
- Pain when touched
- Rapid spreading

## Treatment Steps

### 1. Clip the Fur
Carefully trim hair around the hot spot to expose the area to air.

### 2. Clean the Area
Gently clean with an antiseptic solution or diluted chlorhexidine.

### 3. Apply Medication
Use vet-prescribed topical treatments (antibiotics, hydrocortisone).

### 4. Prevent Licking
Use an e-collar (cone) to prevent further trauma.

### 5. Address the Cause
Identify and treat the underlying issue.

## When to See a Vet

See your vet immediately if:
- The hot spot is large or spreading rapidly
- Your dog is in obvious pain
- There are multiple hot spots
- Home treatment isn't working in 48 hours
- Your dog has a fever

## Prevention Tips

- **Thorough drying** after swimming or bathing
- **Flea prevention** year-round
- **Address allergies** with your vet
- **Reduce stress** with exercise and enrichment
