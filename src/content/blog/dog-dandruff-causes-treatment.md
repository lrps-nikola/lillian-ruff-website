Dandruff in dogs is more than just unsightly—it often signals an underlying skin issue that needs attention. Understanding the cause is key to effective treatment.

## What Is Dog Dandruff?

Dandruff consists of dead skin cells that flake off the skin surface. While some cell turnover is normal, excessive flaking indicates a problem.

## Types of Dog Dandruff

- White, dry flakes
- Caused by insufficient oil production

- Yellowish, greasy flakes
- Caused by excess oil production
- Often accompanied by odor

### Environmental
- Low humidity (especially in winter)
- Excessive bathing
- Harsh shampoos

### Nutritional
- Poor-quality diet
- Lack of omega fatty acids
- Dehydration
