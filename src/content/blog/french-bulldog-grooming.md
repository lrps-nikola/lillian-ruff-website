French Bulldogs are adorable companions with distinctive features that require special grooming attention. Their wrinkles, bat ears, and short coats all need regular care.

## The Frenchie Coat

French Bulldogs have:
- Short, smooth, fine coat
- Minimal undercoat
- Moderate shedding
- Easy maintenance overall

## Weekly Grooming Routine

### Brushing (2-3 times weekly)
- Use a rubber curry brush
- Removes loose hair effectively
- Stimulates skin and distributes oils
- Takes just 5-10 minutes

### Wrinkle Care (Daily)
This is crucial for Frenchies!

**How to Clean Wrinkles:**
1. Use a damp cloth or unscented baby wipe
2. Gently clean between each fold
3. Make sure to reach deep folds
4. Dry thoroughly (moisture causes infection)
5. Apply a thin layer of coconut oil or wrinkle cream

**Pay special attention to:**
- Nose rope (above the nose)
- Forehead wrinkles
- Around the eyes
- Lip folds

### Ear Cleaning (Weekly)
French Bulldog ears are prone to problems:
- Large, open ears collect debris
- Clean with ear solution and cotton balls
- Never insert anything into ear canal
- Watch for signs of infection

## Bathing Your Frenchie

### Frequency
Every 4-6 weeks (or when needed)

### Important Tips
- Use lukewarm water (they overheat easily)
- Choose gentle, hypoallergenic shampoo
- Clean wrinkles during bath
- Rinse thoroughly
- Dry completely, especially in folds
- Never leave damp in wrinkles
