Doodle breeds—Goldendoodles, Labradoodles, Bernedoodles, and many more—have exploded in popularity. But their gorgeous coats require significant grooming commitment.

## Understanding Doodle Coats

Doodle coats vary widely:
- **Curly**: Tight curls like a Poodle
- **Wavy/Fleece**: Loose waves (most common)
- **Straight/Flat**: More like the non-Poodle parent

All types require regular grooming, but curly coats are most demanding.

## The Matting Problem

Doodles are notorious for matting because:
- Wavy/curly hair tangles easily
- Low shedding means hair stays in coat
- Many owners underestimate maintenance
- Coat changes from puppy to adult

## Daily Brushing Is Essential

### Tools Needed
- Slicker brush
- Metal comb
- Detangling spray

### Technique
1. Spray with detangler
2. Brush in sections, getting to skin
3. Use "line brushing" method
4. Comb through to check for mats
5. Focus on problem areas

### Problem Areas
- Behind ears
- Under collar
- Armpits
- Behind legs
- Groin area
- Tail

## Professional Grooming Schedule

Doodles need grooming every 6-8 weeks:
- Full bath and dry
- Complete haircut
- Dematting if needed
- Ear cleaning
- Nail trim

## Popular Doodle Haircuts

### Teddy Bear Cut
- Round, fluffy face
- Even body length (1-2 inches)
- Most requested style

### Puppy Cut
- Same length all over
- Various lengths available
- Easy to maintain

### Lamb Cut
- Shorter body
- Fuller legs
- Clean face

### Summer Cut
- Short all over
- Keeps them cool
- Lowest maintenance

## Preventing Matting

1. **Brush daily** (non-negotiable for curly coats)
2. **Keep regular grooming appointments**
3. **Consider a shorter cut** if maintenance is difficult
4. **Remove collar** when not needed
5. **Dry thoroughly** after baths or swimming

## The Matted Doodle Dilemma

If severely matted:
- Shaving may be the only option
- Dematting can be painful and expensive
- Prevention is always better
- The coat will grow back

## Coat Changes

Doodle puppies often have different coats than adults:
- Adult coat comes in around 6-12 months
- Often becomes curlier and denser
- Grooming needs typically increase

## At-Home Care Between Appointments

- Brush every day or every other day
- Wipe eyes daily
- Clean ears weekly
- Check for mats regularly
- Maintain good nutrition

Keep your Doodle fluffy and mat-free! [Book a grooming appointment](/grooming).
