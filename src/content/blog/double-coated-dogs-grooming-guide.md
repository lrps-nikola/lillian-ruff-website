Double-coated breeds have a soft, dense undercoat beneath a longer outer coat. This special fur requires specific grooming techniques to keep your dog comfortable and healthy.

## What Is a Double Coat?

A double coat consists of:
- **Undercoat**: Soft, fluffy, insulating layer
- **Guard hairs**: Longer, coarser outer layer that repels water and dirt

## Common Double-Coated Breeds

- Siberian Huskies
- Alaskan Malamutes
- German Shepherds
- Golden Retrievers
- Labrador Retrievers
- Samoyeds
- Pomeranians
- Corgis
- Australian Shepherds
- Border Collies

## Never Shave a Double Coat!

This is crucial: **shaving a double-coated dog is harmful**. The undercoat:
- Regulates body temperature (keeps them cool AND warm)
- Protects against sunburn
- May never grow back properly if shaved

## Proper Grooming Techniques

### 1. Use the Right Brush
- **Undercoat rake** - removes loose undercoat
- **Slicker brush** - smooths and removes tangles
- **Pin brush** - for finishing

### 2. Brush in Layers
Part the fur and brush in sections, working from skin outward to ensure you reach the undercoat.

### 3. Regular De-shedding
During shedding season (spring and fall), brush daily to remove the "blown" undercoat.

### 4. Bathe Strategically
Bathe every 6-8 weeks with a deshedding shampoo, followed by thorough drying.

## Shedding Season Tips

When your double-coated dog "blows" their coat:
- Brush daily for 15-20 minutes
- Use a deshedding tool weekly
- Consider a professional grooming session
- Invest in a good vacuum!

## Professional Grooming Benefits

A professional deshedding treatment can remove up to 80% of loose undercoat. [Book a deshedding session](/grooming) today!
