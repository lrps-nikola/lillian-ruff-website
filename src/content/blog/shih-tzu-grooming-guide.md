The Shih Tzu, meaning "lion dog," is known for its beautiful, flowing coat. While stunning, this coat requires dedicated grooming to stay healthy and tangle-free.

## Understanding the Shih Tzu Coat

Shih Tzus have a double coat that:
- Grows continuously (like human hair)
- Doesn't shed much but mats easily
- Requires daily attention
- Can be kept long or trimmed short

## Daily Care Requirements

### Brushing (Essential!)
Shih Tzus need daily brushing to prevent mats:
1. Use a pin brush for the outer coat
2. Follow with a slicker brush for tangles
3. Use a metal comb to check for hidden mats
4. Be gentle around face, ears, and legs

### Face Care
- Wipe eyes daily to prevent tear staining
- Clean facial folds
- Keep beard clean after meals
- Check for food debris in mustache

### Topknot Maintenance
If keeping hair long:
- Brush topknot daily
- Use soft, gentle bands
- Change position regularly to prevent breakage
