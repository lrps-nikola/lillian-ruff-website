Summer brings unique challenges for dog grooming. From managing heat to protecting paws from hot pavement, here's how to keep your pup comfortable during the warm months.

## The Shaving Myth

Many owners think shaving will cool their dogs. However:

### Never Shave Double-Coated Breeds
- The undercoat actually insulates against heat
- Shaving increases sunburn risk
- Coat may not regrow properly
- It doesn't help them stay cool

### When Shaving May Help
- Single-coated breeds
- Medical necessity
- Severely matted coats (as last resort)

## Summer Grooming Strategies

### Keep Coats Well-Brushed
- Remove loose undercoat for better air circulation
- Prevent mats that trap heat
- Distribute natural oils

### Appropriate Trimming
- Trim belly hair slightly shorter
- Keep paw pad hair short
- Neaten sanitary areas
- Consider a "summer cut" for appropriate breeds

### Regular Deshedding
- Remove excess undercoat
- Professional treatments are very effective
- Reduces overheating risk

## Bathing in Summer

### More Frequent Baths May Be Needed
- Swimming dogs need rinsing
- Active dogs get dirtier
- Allergies may flare up

### After Swimming
- Rinse off chlorine, salt, or pond water
- Dry ears thoroughly
- Check for debris
- Prevent hot spots

## Paw Protection

### Hot Pavement Dangers
- Pavement can reach 140°F+ when air temp is 85°F
- Test with back of your hand (5-second rule)
- Walk during cooler hours
- Use paw wax or booties

### After Walks
- Check for burns or blisters
- Wipe paws to remove allergens
- Inspect between toes

## Sun Protection

### Dogs Can Get Sunburned
At-risk areas:
- Nose
- Ears
- Belly (especially on light-colored dogs)
- Any thin-coated areas

### Protection Tips
- Use pet-safe sunscreen
- Provide shade outdoors
- Limit midday sun exposure
- Consider UV-protective clothing

## Hydration and Skin

- Dehydration affects coat quality
- Always provide fresh, cool water
- Watch for dry skin
- Consider adding omega fatty acids

## Pest Prevention

Summer means more parasites:
- Maintain flea and tick prevention
- Check for ticks after outdoor time
- Watch for signs of bites or irritation
- Regular grooming helps spot problems early

## Signs of Overheating

Watch for:
- Excessive panting
- Drooling
- Lethargy
- Red gums
- Vomiting
- Collapse

If you see these signs, cool your dog gradually and seek vet care.
