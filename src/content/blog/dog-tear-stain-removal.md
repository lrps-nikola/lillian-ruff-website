Tear stains are those reddish-brown streaks that run from the inner corner of a dog's eyes down their muzzle. While especially visible on light-colored dogs, all dogs can develop them.

## What Causes Tear Stains?

### Porphyrin
The main culprit is porphyrin, a pigment in tears, saliva, and urine that turns reddish-brown when exposed to air and sunlight.

### Excessive Tearing (Epiphora)
Causes include:
- Blocked tear ducts
- Eye irritation or infection
- Allergies
- Shallow eye sockets (brachycephalic breeds)
- Entropion (inward-rolling eyelids)
- Hair growing into eyes

### Other Factors
- Genetics
- Diet
- Water quality (high mineral content)
- Teething in puppies
- Yeast or bacterial infections

## Breeds Prone to Tear Stains

- Maltese
- Bichon Frise
- Shih Tzu
- Poodles
- Cavalier King Charles Spaniels
- Pugs
- Bulldogs
- Pomeranians

## Removing Existing Stains

### Daily Cleaning
1. Use a warm, damp cloth to wipe under eyes
2. Dry thoroughly (moisture breeds bacteria)
3. Use a flea comb to remove debris

### Tear Stain Removers
- Commercial tear stain products
- Colloidal silver solution
- Diluted hydrogen peroxide (carefully, avoid eyes)
- Coconut oil (natural antibacterial)

### Professional Grooming
Groomers can safely trim stained fur and recommend products.

## Prevention Strategies

### Keep the Area Dry
- Wipe eyes 2-3 times daily
- Trim hair around eyes
- Use a small amount of cornstarch to absorb moisture

### Address Diet
- Feed high-quality food
- Use filtered or bottled water
- Avoid food with artificial dyes
- Consider adding probiotics

### Maintain Hygiene
- Keep facial fur trimmed
- Wash food and water bowls daily
- Regular grooming appointments

### Address Health Issues
See your vet if staining is sudden or severe to rule out:
- Eye infections
- Blocked tear ducts
- Allergies

## What to Avoid

- **Antibiotics** without vet supervision
- **Harsh chemicals** near eyes
- **Bleach-based products**
- **Ignoring underlying conditions**

## Realistic Expectations

For genetically prone breeds, tear staining may never completely disappear, but consistent care can significantly reduce it.
