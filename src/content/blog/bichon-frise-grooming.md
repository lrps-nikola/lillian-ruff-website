The Bichon Frise, with its bright white, fluffy coat, looks like a living cotton ball. Maintaining this signature look requires commitment and proper techniques.

## Understanding the Bichon Coat

Bichon coats are unique:
- Double coat with soft, dense undercoat
- Curly outer coat
- Continuously growing hair
- Low shedding but high maintenance
- Pure white (though cream is acceptable)

## Daily Care Requirements

### Brushing (Daily is Best)
- Use a slicker brush
- Brush in sections
- Get down to the skin
- Follow with a comb
- Check for mats

### Facial Care

- Keep beard clean
- Trim hair around eyes if needed

## Professional Grooming Schedule

Bichons need grooming every 4-6 weeks:
