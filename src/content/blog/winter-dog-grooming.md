Winter weather requires special attention to your dog's grooming routine. From dry skin to icy paws, here's how to keep your pup comfortable all winter long.

## Winter Coat Care

### Don't Over-Bathe
- Bathing strips natural oils
- Oils protect against cold and dry air
- Bathe every 6-8 weeks maximum
- Use moisturizing shampoos

### Keep Up the Brushing
- Removes dead coat
- Prevents mats (especially with sweaters)
- Distributes natural oils
- Improves insulation

### Resist Shaving
- Dogs need their coats for warmth
- Undercoats provide crucial insulation
- Trim minimally if needed

## Dry Skin Solutions

Winter often brings dry, flaky skin:

### Causes
- Indoor heating
- Low humidity
- Cold, dry outdoor air
- Over-bathing

### Solutions
- Use humidifiers in your home
- Apply pet-safe moisturizers
- Add omega fatty acids to diet
- Use moisturizing grooming products
- Reduce bathing frequency

## Paw Winter Care

### Dangers
- Ice and snow between toes
- Salt and chemical deicers
- Cracked, dry pads
- Frostbite

### Protection
1. **Trim paw fur** to prevent ice balls
2. **Apply paw wax** before walks
3. **Consider booties** for long walks
4. **Wipe paws** immediately after walks
5. **Check between toes** for ice buildup

### After Walks
Always wipe paws with a warm, damp cloth to remove:
- Salt (can burn pads and is toxic if licked)
- Chemical deicers
- Antifreeze (extremely toxic!)

## Indoor Grooming Adjustments

### Static Electricity
- Common in dry winter air
- Use conditioning sprays
- Consider a humidifier
- Use anti-static grooming tools

### Mat Prevention
- Dogs wearing sweaters or coats mat more easily
- Brush before and after wearing clothing
- Check armpits and collar areas

## Dogs That Need Extra Winter Care

### Short-Coated Breeds
May need sweaters or coats:
- Chihuahuas
- Greyhounds
- Whippets
- French Bulldogs
- Dobermans

### Small Dogs
- Closer to cold ground
- Lose body heat faster
- May need protection

### Senior Dogs
- Less able to regulate temperature
- May have arthritis affected by cold
- Need extra warmth

## Signs of Cold Weather Problems

### Frostbite
- Pale, gray skin
- Hard or cold skin
- Pain when touched
- Commonly affects ears, tail, paws

### Hypothermia
- Shivering
- Lethargy
- Weak pulse
- Difficulty walking

Seek immediate veterinary care for either condition.
