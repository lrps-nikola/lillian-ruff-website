Your new puppy's first grooming appointment is an important milestone! A positive early experience sets the stage for a lifetime of stress-free grooming. Here's how to prepare your pup for their spa debut.

## When Should Puppies Start Grooming?

Most puppies can have their first professional grooming after they've completed their initial vaccination series—typically around 12-16 weeks of age. However, you can start at-home grooming practice much earlier!

## At-Home Preparation (Start at 8 Weeks)

### Handle Those Paws

Get your puppy used to having their paws touched:

- Gently hold each paw for a few seconds
- Touch between the toes and pads
- Lightly press on the nails
- Reward with treats and praise

### Practice Ear Touches

Dogs need regular ear cleaning, so:

- Lift the ear flap gently
- Touch around the ear opening
- Use a calm, soothing voice
- Never insert anything into the ear canal

### Introduce Brushing

Even puppies with short coats benefit from brushing practice:

- Use a soft puppy brush
- Keep sessions short (1-2 minutes)
- Make it feel like petting
- Offer treats throughout

### Simulate Bath Time

Before the real thing:

- Let your puppy explore the bathroom
- Run water so they hear the sound
- Use a damp cloth to wipe them down
- Reward calm behavior

## Choosing the Right Groomer

Look for a groomer who:

- Has experience with puppies
- Offers "puppy introduction" appointments
- Uses positive reinforcement techniques
- Will take breaks if your puppy gets stressed
- Communicates openly with you

At Lillian Ruff Pet Spa, we specialize in making first-time grooming experiences positive and fun!

## The Day Before the Appointment

- **Don't** bathe your puppy (let the groomer assess their coat condition)
- **Do** take them for a walk or play session to burn off energy
- **Don't** feed a large meal right before (to prevent upset tummy)
- **Do** make sure they've had a potty break

## What to Expect at the First Visit

A puppy's first grooming session is usually shorter and simpler than adult grooming. It might include:

1. **Introduction and exploration** of the grooming environment
2. **Gentle brushing** to get used to the tools
3. **Quick bath** with puppy-safe products
4. **Blow-dry** on a low, quiet setting
5. **Light nail trim** to start good habits
6. **Lots of breaks** and positive reinforcement

## Red Flags to Watch For

Your puppy should never:

- Be forced or restrained roughly
- Be left unattended
- Show signs of extreme stress that aren't addressed
- Come home with injuries or irritation

## After the Appointment

Celebrate the milestone!

- **Praise your puppy** enthusiastically
- **Offer a special treat** or new toy
- **Keep the rest of the day calm** if they seem tired
- **Note any concerns** to discuss with your groomer

## Building Good Habits

Between grooming appointments:

- Continue practicing at-home handling
- Brush regularly (even if briefly)
- Keep experiences positive
- Stick to a regular grooming schedule

## Common Puppy Grooming Questions

**Q: My puppy is wiggly—is that normal?**
A: Absolutely! Puppies are naturally energetic. Good groomers know how to work with puppy energy.

**Q: What if my puppy is scared?**
A: Some nervousness is normal. A patient groomer will go slowly and make the experience as positive as possible.

**Q: How long will the first appointment take?**
A: Usually 30-45 minutes for a puppy introduction, versus 1-2 hours for adult grooming.
