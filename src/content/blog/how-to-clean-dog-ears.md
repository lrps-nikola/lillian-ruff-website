Regular ear cleaning is essential for preventing infections, especially in dogs with floppy ears or those that swim frequently.

## Why Ear Cleaning Matters

Dogs' ear canals are L-shaped, making them prone to trapping moisture, debris, and wax. This warm, dark environment is perfect for bacteria and yeast growth.

## Signs of Ear Problems

Watch for these warning signs:
- Head shaking or tilting
- Scratching at ears
- Redness or swelling
- Brown or yellow discharge
- Unpleasant odor
- Sensitivity when ears are touched

## What You'll Need

- Veterinary-approved ear cleaning solution
- Cotton balls or gauze pads
- Treats for positive reinforcement
- Towel (it can get messy!)

## Step-by-Step Ear Cleaning

### 1. Get Your Dog Comfortable
Choose a calm time and have treats ready. Some dogs do better after exercise.

### 2. Examine the Ears
Look for redness, discharge, or swelling. If you see signs of infection, skip cleaning and see your vet.

### 3. Apply the Solution
Fill the ear canal with cleaning solution until you can see the liquid.

### 4. Massage the Base
Gently massage the base of the ear for 20-30 seconds. You'll hear a squishing sound.

### 5. Let Your Dog Shake
Step back and let them shake out the excess solution.

### 6. Wipe Clean
Use cotton balls to wipe out the visible part of the ear canal and the ear flap.

## Important Don'ts

- **Don't use Q-tips** - they can damage the ear canal
- **Don't insert anything deep** into the ear
- **Don't use water** - it doesn't evaporate well
- **Don't clean infected ears** - see your vet first

## How Often to Clean

- **Most dogs**: Every 2-4 weeks
- **Floppy-eared breeds**: Weekly
- **Swimmers**: After every swim
- **Allergic dogs**: As recommended by your vet
