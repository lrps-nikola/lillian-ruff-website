Mats are clumps of tangled fur that can form close to your dog's skin. They're more than just unsightly—they can cause pain, skin irritation, and even infections if left untreated.

## Why Do Mats Form?

Mats typically develop from:
- Lack of regular brushing
- Moisture from baths, rain, or swimming
- Friction from collars, harnesses, or sleeping positions
- Shedding undercoat getting trapped
- Outdoor debris like burrs or leaves

## Tools You'll Need

- **Slicker brush** - for surface tangles
- **Dematting comb** - for working through mats
- **Detangling spray** - to ease the process
- **Blunt-tipped scissors** - for severe mats only

## Step-by-Step Mat Removal

### 1. Assess the Situation
Feel the mat to determine how close it is to the skin and how severe it is. Small, loose mats are manageable at home; large, tight mats may need professional attention.

### 2. Apply Detangling Spray
Spray the mat generously and let it sit for a few minutes to soften the fur.

### 3. Work from the Outside In
Starting at the outer edges of the mat, use your fingers to gently separate small sections of fur.

### 4. Use the Right Tools
Use a dematting comb with sharp blades to cut through the mat vertically, working in small sections.

### 5. Brush Through
Once the mat is loosened, use a slicker brush to smooth out the remaining tangles.

## When to See a Professional

Seek professional grooming help if:
- Mats are close to the skin
- Your dog shows signs of pain
- There are multiple large mats
- The skin underneath appears red or irritated
- You're unsure about safely removing the mat

## Prevention Is Key

Prevent mats by:
- Brushing regularly (daily for long coats)
- Drying your dog thoroughly after baths
- Removing harnesses when not in use
- Scheduling regular professional grooming
