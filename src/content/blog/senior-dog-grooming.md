As dogs age, their grooming needs change. With patience, gentleness, and the right approach, grooming can remain a positive experience that supports their health and wellbeing.

## How Aging Affects Grooming

### Physical Changes
- **Arthritis**: Makes standing and positioning difficult
- **Thin skin**: More susceptible to irritation
- **Coat changes**: May become dry, thin, or coarse
- **Reduced mobility**: Can't groom themselves as effectively
- **Sensitivity**: May be more reactive to touch

### Health Considerations
- Heart conditions
- Vision and hearing loss
- Cognitive decline
- Medication sensitivities
- Slower healing

## Adapting Your Grooming Routine

### Create a Comfortable Setup
- Use non-slip mats
- Provide padding for joints
- Keep the room warm
- Reduce noise and commotion
- Allow frequent breaks

### Modify Techniques
- Use gentler strokes
- Avoid pulling or tugging
- Support joints when lifting paws
- Work in shorter sessions
- Be patient with movement

### Choose Appropriate Tools
- Softer brushes
- Quieter clippers
- Smaller, easier-to-handle nail trimmers
- Gentle, moisturizing products

## Common Senior Dog Issues

### Dry, Flaky Skin
- Use moisturizing shampoos and conditioners
- Add omega fatty acids to diet
- Brush gently to distribute natural oils
- Consider leave-in conditioners

### Matting
- Seniors may mat more easily due to:
  - Less self-grooming
  - Lying in one position
  - Coat texture changes
- Regular, gentle brushing prevents mats
- Keep coat shorter if maintenance is difficult

### Overgrown Nails
- Less activity means less natural wear
- Check and trim more frequently
- Watch for curling into paw pads
- Keep nails at comfortable length

### Dental Issues
- Bad breath may worsen
- Maintain dental care routine
- Softer dental chews may help
- Regular veterinary dental checks

## Grooming Benefits for Seniors

### Health Monitoring
Regular grooming helps you notice:
- New lumps or bumps
- Skin changes
- Weight loss
- Mobility issues
- Pain points

### Comfort
- Removes mats that pull and hurt
- Keeps nails at comfortable length
- Cleans ears to prevent infections
- Maintains hygiene

### Bonding
- Gentle touch provides comfort

## When to Seek Help
