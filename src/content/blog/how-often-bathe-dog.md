The answer to "how often should I bathe my dog?" isn't one-size-fits-all. It depends on several factors unique to your pup.

## General Guidelines

Most dogs do well with bathing every 4-6 weeks. However, this varies based on:
- Coat type
- Skin conditions
- Activity level
- Living environment

## Bathing by Coat Type

### Short, Smooth Coats (Beagles, Boxers)
- **Frequency**: Every 6-8 weeks
- **Notes**: These coats naturally repel dirt

### Double Coats (Huskies, Golden Retrievers)
- **Frequency**: Every 6-8 weeks
- **Notes**: Brush thoroughly before bathing

### Long, Silky Coats (Yorkies, Maltese)
- **Frequency**: Every 2-4 weeks
- **Notes**: Use conditioner to prevent tangles

### Wire/Coarse Coats (Terriers, Schnauzers)
- **Frequency**: Every 4-6 weeks
- **Notes**: May need hand-stripping

### Curly Coats (Poodles, Bichons)
- **Frequency**: Every 3-4 weeks
- **Notes**: Professional grooming recommended

### Hairless Breeds (Chinese Crested)
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Notes**: Need moisturizer after bathing

## Signs Your Dog Needs a Bath

- Noticeable odor
- Visible dirt or mud
- Greasy or oily coat
- Excessive scratching
- Dull, lackluster fur

## Signs You're Bathing Too Often

- Dry, flaky skin
- Increased scratching
- Dull coat
- Skin irritation

## Factors That Increase Bathing Needs

- **Allergies**: May require weekly medicated baths
- **Outdoor activities**: After hiking, swimming, or muddy play
- **Skin conditions**: As directed by your vet
- **Rolling in smelly things**: Immediately!

## Bathing Tips

1. **Brush before bathing** to remove loose fur and tangles
2. **Use lukewarm water** - not hot or cold
3. **Protect ears** with cotton balls
4. **Use dog shampoo** - human products are too harsh
5. **Rinse thoroughly** - leftover shampoo causes irritation
6. **Dry completely** - especially in skin folds

## Between Baths

Keep your dog fresh between baths with:
- Regular brushing
- Dry shampoo or grooming wipes
- Paw wipes after walks
- Dental care for fresh breath
