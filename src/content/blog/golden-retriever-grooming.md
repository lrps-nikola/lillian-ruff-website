Golden Retrievers are beloved for their friendly personalities and beautiful golden coats. But that gorgeous fur requires consistent care to stay healthy and manageable.

## Understanding the Golden Coat

Goldens have a double coat:
- **Undercoat**: Dense, water-resistant, insulating
- **Outer coat**: Longer, wavy, water-repellent guard hairs

This coat naturally protects them from heat, cold, and water—which is why you should never shave a Golden!

## Grooming Schedule

### Daily (5-10 minutes)
- Quick brushing to prevent tangles
- Check for debris, ticks, or burrs

### Weekly (20-30 minutes)
- Thorough brushing session
- Ear cleaning
- Paw inspection

### Monthly
- Nail trimming
- Bath (or every 6-8 weeks)
- Teeth brushing

### Every 6-8 Weeks
- Professional grooming
- Sanitary trim
- Feathering trim

## Brushing Techniques

### Tools Needed
- Slicker brush
- Undercoat rake
- Pin brush
- Metal comb

### Step-by-Step
1. Use the undercoat rake to remove loose undercoat
2. Follow with slicker brush for tangles
3. Use pin brush on featherings (legs, chest, tail)
4. Finish with metal comb to check for remaining tangles

### Problem Areas
Pay extra attention to:
- Behind the ears
- Under the collar
- Armpits
- Belly and groin
- Behind the back legs
- Tail feathering

## Bathing Tips

- Brush thoroughly before bathing
- Use a deshedding shampoo
- Condition the featherings
- Rinse completely
- Dry the undercoat thoroughly (use a high-velocity dryer)

## Shedding Management

Goldens shed moderately year-round and heavily twice a year ("blowing coat").

During heavy shedding:
- Brush daily
- Use a deshedding tool
- Consider professional deshedding treatments
- Vacuum frequently!

## Trimming (Never Shaving!)

Professional groomers can neaten:
- Feet (remove "slippers")
- Ears (thin excess hair)
- Featherings (trim to even length)
- Sanitary areas
- Tail shaping

## Common Issues

### Matting
Prevent with regular brushing. Never cut mats out with scissors—see a groomer.

### Hot Spots
Common in Goldens due to thick coat. Keep coat clean and dry.

### Ear Infections
Those floppy ears trap moisture. Clean weekly.

### Dry Skin
Use moisturizing shampoo and add omega fatty acids to diet.
