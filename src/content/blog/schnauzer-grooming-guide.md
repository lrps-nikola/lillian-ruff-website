Schnauzers—whether Miniature, Standard, or Giant—are known for their distinctive beards, bushy eyebrows, and wiry coats. Maintaining this classic look requires regular grooming.

## Understanding the Schnauzer Coat

Schnauzers have a double coat:
- **Wiry outer coat**: Harsh, protective
- **Soft undercoat**: Provides insulation
- **Facial furnishings**: Beard and eyebrows

## Hand Stripping vs. Clipping

### Hand Stripping
- Traditional method for show dogs
- Pulls dead outer coat by hand
- Maintains proper wire texture
- More time-consuming and expensive
- Keeps coat colors vibrant

### Clipping
- Common for pet Schnauzers
- Faster and less expensive
- Coat may become softer over time
- Colors may fade slightly
- Perfectly acceptable for pets

## The Classic Schnauzer Cut

The traditional Schnauzer style includes:
- Short body coat
- Longer leg furnishings
- Full, shaped beard
- Bushy eyebrows
- Trimmed ears
- Tight feet

## Grooming Schedule

### Professional Grooming: Every 6-8 weeks
- Full body clip or strip
- Beard and eyebrow shaping
- Leg furnishing maintenance
- Ear cleaning and plucking
- Nail trimming

### At-Home Care: Weekly
- Brush body and furnishings
- Clean and comb beard
- Wipe eyebrows
- Check ears

## Beard Care

The Schnauzer beard needs special attention:

### Daily
- Wipe after eating and drinking
- Check for food debris
- Keep dry to prevent odor

### Weekly
- Thorough combing
- Check for tangles
- Clean with pet wipes

### Common Issues
- Food staining
- Water bowl wetness
- Tangles and mats
- Yeast growth (brown staining)

## Eyebrow Maintenance

- Comb regularly to prevent matting
- Trim if they block vision
- Keep clean around eyes
- Shape during grooming appointments

## Body Coat Care

### Brushing
- Use slicker brush for body
- Comb through leg furnishings
- Check for mats, especially in armpits

### Bathing
- Every 4-6 weeks
- Use quality shampoo
- Condition furnishings
- Dry thoroughly

## Ear Care

Schnauzers often need ear hair removed:
- Hair grows in ear canal
- Can trap moisture and debris
- Pluck or trim as needed
- Clean regularly

## Common Schnauzer Issues

### Skin Bumps (Schnauzer Comedone Syndrome)
- Blackhead-like bumps on back
- Common in the breed
- Regular grooming helps
- May need medicated shampoo

### Allergies
- Can cause skin irritation
- May affect coat quality
- Work with vet for treatment
