A dog's paws are remarkable—they provide cushioning, traction, and protection. But they're also exposed to everything from hot pavement to ice and salt. Proper paw care is essential for your dog's comfort and health.

## Anatomy of the Paw

- **Pads**: Thick, fatty tissue that cushions and protects
- **Nails**: Provide traction and digging ability
- **Dewclaws**: Vestigial "thumbs" (not all dogs have rear dewclaws)
- **Digital pads**: Under each toe
- **Metacarpal/Metatarsal pad**: Large central pad

## Daily Paw Care

### After Walks
- Check for debris between toes
- Look for cuts or injuries
- Wipe paws to remove dirt, chemicals, allergens
- Inspect for thorns, burrs, or glass

### Regular Inspection
- Feel for lumps or swelling
- Check nail length
- Look for cracked or dry pads
- Examine between toes for redness or irritation

## Nail Care

### Signs Nails Are Too Long
- Clicking on hard floors
- Nails touching ground when standing
- Difficulty walking
- Curling or twisting

### Trimming Tips
- Trim every 3-4 weeks
- Use sharp, appropriate-sized clippers
- Avoid cutting the quick
- Have styptic powder ready
- Consider professional help for dark nails

## Pad Care

### Keeping Pads Healthy
- Moisturize with paw balm (not human lotion)
- Trim excess fur between pads
- Check for cracks regularly
- Keep nails trimmed (long nails affect pad contact)

### Treating Dry/Cracked Pads
- Clean gently
- Apply paw balm or coconut oil
- Consider paw socks while healing
- Avoid irritating surfaces

## Seasonal Paw Protection

### Summer
**Risks**: Hot pavement, sand, chemicals

**Protection**:
- Walk during cooler hours
- Test pavement with back of your hand (5 seconds)
- Use paw wax for protection
- Consider booties
- Rinse paws after beach visits

### Winter
**Risks**: Ice, snow, salt, chemicals

**Protection**:
- Use pet-safe ice melt at home
- Wipe paws after walks (remove salt)
- Apply paw wax before walks
- Consider booties for extended time outdoors
- Trim fur between pads to prevent ice balls

## Common Paw Problems

### Allergies
- Licking, chewing, and redness between toes
- May need veterinary treatment
- Keep paws clean
- Consider hypoallergenic diets

### Yeast Infections
- Reddish-brown staining
- Musty odor
- Excessive licking
- Requires antifungal treatment

### Foreign Objects
- Thorns, foxtails, glass
- Signs: Limping, licking, swelling
- Remove carefully or see vet

### Cuts and Injuries
- Clean with antiseptic
- Apply antibiotic ointment
- Bandage if needed
- See vet for deep cuts

### Burned Pads
- From hot surfaces
- Signs: Limping, discoloration, blisters
- Cool with water
- See vet for treatment

## Fur Between Pads

Keep the fur between your dog's pads trimmed to:
- Prevent matting
- Improve traction
- Stop debris accumulation
- Prevent ice balls in winter
