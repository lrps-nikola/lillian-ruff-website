Those clicking sounds when your dog walks across the floor? That's a sign their nails are overdue for a trim. While it might seem like a minor grooming task, regular nail maintenance is crucial for your dog's overall health and comfort.

## The Hidden Dangers of Overgrown Nails

### Pain and Discomfort

When nails grow too long, they push against the ground with every step, forcing your dog's toes into unnatural positions. This can cause:

- Joint pain and arthritis over time
- Difficulty walking or running
- Reluctance to exercise or play
- Changes in posture and gait

### Increased Injury Risk

Long nails are more likely to:

- **Snag and tear** on carpet, fabric, or outdoor surfaces
- **Split painfully** down to the quick
- **Curl under** and grow into the paw pad (especially on dewclaws)

### Foot Problems

Overgrown nails can lead to:

- Splayed toes and deformed feet
- Reduced traction on slippery surfaces
- Increased risk of slipping and falling

## How Often Should Nails Be Trimmed?

Most dogs need nail trims every 3-4 weeks, but this varies based on:

- **Activity level**: Dogs who walk on pavement may naturally wear down their nails
- **Nail growth rate**: Some dogs' nails grow faster than others
- **Age**: Senior dogs often need more frequent trims

**The rule of thumb**: If you can hear clicking when your dog walks on hard floors, it's time for a trim!

## The Quick: What You Need to Know

The "quick" is the blood vessel and nerve inside each nail. It's visible as a pink area in light-colored nails but hidden in dark nails.

- **Regular trimming** keeps the quick from growing too long
- **Neglected nails** cause the quick to extend, making trimming more difficult
- **Professional groomers** are skilled at trimming even the trickiest dark nails safely

## Signs Your Dog's Nails Are Too Long

- Clicking sounds on hard floors
- Nails touching the ground when standing
- Visible curving of the nails
- Difficulty walking or limping
- Reluctance to have paws touched

## Professional vs. At-Home Nail Trimming

While some pet parents trim nails at home, there are advantages to professional grooming:

**Professional Benefits:**
- Proper tools designed for different nail sizes
- Experience with anxious or wiggly dogs
- Ability to safely trim dark nails
- Quick identification of nail problems
- Styptic powder on hand if the quick is nicked

## Tips for Nail-Anxious Dogs

Many dogs dislike nail trims. Here's how to make it easier:

1. **Start young** with paw handling
2. **Use positive reinforcement** with treats
3. **Keep sessions short** and stress-free
4. **Stay calm**—your dog picks up on your anxiety
5. **Consider professional help** for very anxious pups

## Don't Forget the Dewclaws!

Those "thumbs" on your dog's inner legs need attention too. Dewclaws don't touch the ground, so they never wear down naturally and can curl into the paw pad if neglected.
