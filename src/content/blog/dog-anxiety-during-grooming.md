Many dogs experience anxiety around grooming. Whether it's the sound of clippers, running water, or simply being handled, fear can make grooming stressful for everyone.

## Signs of Grooming Anxiety

- Trembling or shaking
- Panting excessively
- Trying to escape
- Hiding or cowering
- Growling or snapping
- Drooling
- Refusing to enter the grooming area
- Submissive urination

## Why Dogs Fear Grooming

- Negative past experiences
- Lack of early exposure
- Sensitivity to sounds (clippers, dryers)
- Discomfort with restraint
- Pain from mats, skin conditions, or previous injuries
- General anxiety disorder

## Desensitization Techniques

### Start Small
Begin with handling exercises at home:
- Touch paws, ears, and tail
- Lift lips to see teeth
- Run hands over the entire body
- Reward calm behavior

### Introduce Tools Gradually
1. Show the tool without using it
2. Let them sniff and investigate
3. Turn on clippers/dryer from a distance
4. Gradually move closer over days/weeks
5. Always pair with treats

### Practice Mock Sessions
- Pretend to groom without actually doing it
- Keep sessions short (2-5 minutes)
- End on a positive note
- Gradually increase duration

## At-Home Calming Strategies

- **Exercise before grooming** - a tired dog is calmer
- **Use calming music** - classical or specially designed pet music
- **Try calming aids** - Thundershirts, pheromone sprays
- **Create positive associations** - treats, praise, toys
- **Stay calm yourself** - dogs sense your emotions

## Choosing the Right Groomer

Look for groomers who:
- Use gentle handling techniques
- Allow breaks during sessions
- Work at the dog's pace
- Have experience with anxious dogs
- Create a calm environment

## When to Seek Professional Help

If anxiety is severe, consult:
- Your veterinarian (may recommend anti-anxiety medication)
- A certified animal behaviorist
- A professional dog trainer
