                Grooming procedures can sometimes be stressful, particularly for senior pets or pets with health problems. Such stress can expose hidden medical issues or aggravate existing conditions during or after the grooming session. In the best interest of your pet, by agreeing to these Terms, you grant Lillian Ruff Pet Spa permission to obtain immediate veterinary treatment for your pet if we deem it necessary during the grooming process. We will make every effort to contact you first and take your pet to your authorized veterinarian, or to the nearest available veterinarian if yours is unavailable. You agree that all expenses for veterinary care will be your responsibility and will be covered by you, the pet owner.

                Mat Removal
              </h2>
              <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Pets with matted coats require extra attention during grooming. Mats that are left in a pet's coat can tighten over time, potentially strangling the pet's skin or causing it to tear open. At Lillian Ruff Pet Spa, we prioritize your pet's comfort and will not continuously demat a pet if it causes serious or undue stress. Mats can be very difficult to remove and may require shaving the pet. Removing a heavily matted coat carries risks, including nicks, cuts, or abrasions due to warts, moles, or skin folds trapped in the mats. Heavy matting can also trap moisture and urine near the pet's skin, leading to mold, fungus, or bacterial growth, which may cause skin irritations that predate the grooming process. In severe cases, torn skin from mats can harbor maggots.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                After-effects of mat removal may include itchiness, hematomas, skin redness, self-inflicted irritations or abrasions, and failure of the hair to regrow. Shaved pets are also prone to sunburn and should have sunscreen applied daily or be kept out of the sun until the hair grows sufficiently to protect the skin. In some cases, pets may exhibit brief behavioral changes following mat removal.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Prevention is the best defense against matting. We strongly recommend scheduling regular grooming appointments to maintain your pet's coat. Lillian Ruff Pet Spa will not be held responsible for any injuries or after-effects resulting from mat removal, including those listed above.

                Accidents
              </h2>
              <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                While we use extreme caution and care in all grooming situations, there is always a possibility that an accident may occur. Grooming equipment is sharp, and possible issues such as cuts, nicks, scratches, or quicking of nails may happen, especially with an excited or uncooperative pet. We make every effort to ensure your pet is groomed as safely as possible, but an excited pet can be dangerous to work with. By agreeing to these Terms, you acknowledge these risks and agree that Lillian Ruff Pet Spa will not be held liable for such accidents, provided we have exercised reasonable care.

                Parasites
              </h2>
              <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                If you suspect your pet has fleas or ticks, you must take prompt and thorough action to address the issue. Flea infestations can lead to tapeworms and other health problems for your pet. If fleas or ticks are discovered during the grooming process, your pet will be treated with a natural product to kill the parasites, and you will be charged for the use of flea shampoo. Please note that Lillian Ruff Pet Spa does not use pesticide dips or sprays on pets. Ticks will be removed for an additional charge. If ticks are found, we strongly recommend having your pet tested for Lyme Disease, as parasites pose a health hazard to both your pet and humans. You agree to cover any additional charges for parasite treatment as outlined.

                By agreeing to these Terms, you (or your authorized agent) agree to hold Lillian Ruff Pet Spa, its owners, operators, employees, officers, and directors harmless from any damage, loss, or claim arising from any condition of your pet, whether known or unknown to Lillian Ruff Pet Spa.

                No-shows and last-minute cancellations are subject to a fee of 50% of the full service fee per pet. If you cancel within 48 hours of your appointment, you will be charged this fee. We understand that emergency situations may arise, and we will work with you on a case-by-case basis, but repeated cancellations or no-shows will not be accommodated. As a by-appointment business, we rely on timely cancellations to offer slots to other clients. Cancellations must be made by calling or texting through MoeGo; we do not accept cancellations via email. You agree to adhere to our cancellation policy and pay any applicable fees for no-shows or late cancellations.

                Booking Accuracy
              </h2>
              <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Lillian Ruff Pet Spa operates as a by-appointment business, and our schedules are created based on the specific details provided for each pet, including breed, weight, and the type of service requested.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>Weight Accuracy:</strong> We schedule appointments based on the weight you provide for your pet. For example, a 60 lbs. dog requires a different time slot than an 80 lbs. dog. If you provide incorrect weight information by 15 lbs. or more, you will be charged an additional fee, as this impacts our scheduling and affects other clients. We do not accept dogs over 145 lbs., and you must inform us if your dog is 100 lbs. or over before booking or include this information in the notes when you book.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Service Accuracy:</strong> Our scheduling also depends on the type of service booked. For example, a bath and brush appointment takes less time than a full-service groom. If you book a bath and brush but request a full service upon arrival, your request may be denied due to time constraints. If you book a full service but request a bath and brush upon arrival, you will be charged a fee, as we reserved a longer time slot for the full service, which could have been used for another client. Please ensure you book the correct service to avoid delays or additional fees. You agree to provide accurate information about your pet's weight and the requested service when booking, and to pay any applicable fees if incorrect information causes scheduling disruptions.
